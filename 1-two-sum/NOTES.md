# Solution

## Naive approach

We choose an *element* of the *array* and loop through the rest to see if the sum of the *first element* with the *second element* is equal to the *target*. Which, unfortunately, results in time complexity of `O(nÂ²)`.

```python
def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    response = []
	for i in range(len(nums)):
		for j in range(i, len(nums)):
			if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
				response.append([nums[i], nums[j]])
	return response

```

## Efficient approach

In this approach, if we find an *element* that is less than the *target*, we can save the *index* and the *element* in a *hashmap*. Then, if the result of `target - element` already exists in the *map* we know that `target = current-element + the repeated value`. Finding the solution in `O(n)`.

```python
def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    seen = {}
    for i, value in enumerate(nums):
        remaining = target - nums[i]
        
        if remaining in seen:
            return [i, seen[remaining]]
        seen[value] = i 
```
